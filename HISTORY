MasterMind 1.1.1b


HISTORY
-------

version 1.0 was first done at my school days at ESCOM (Escuela Superior de
Computo, from the IPN - Instituto Politecnico Nacional at Mexico city) in
1998, as my first school project in C for the first semester of Programming
Languages in that school. It is perhaps the first game I've ever wrote (note,
though, that it is not my first program, I've been programming in C since my
nbachelor days, sometime around 1996, and have done primitive programming in
prehistoric languages like BASIC some years before too). Why I chose Master
Mind as my first programming project in C has its history too: when I was an
almost 12 years old kid, I've got operated from my appendix, and someone
(can't remember who, perhaps some aunt), gave me as a gift a version of that
fine mental board game. Since then it's been one of my favorites (despite the
fact that I play it seldom, just as seldom as I used to maintain this program
unitl now :-P)

version 1.0.1 improved the help and about online sections

version 1.0.2 came from my efforts in 2006 to upgrade the program so the Three
Wise Men (the 'Tres Reyes Magos', a mexican tradition (and surely from some
other places with hispanic/catholic traditions) for kids celebrated every 6th
january) could give my then girlfriend (and now wife) a nice gift ;-) Since
she is a psychologist, she had told me about an evaluation scale for the
Master Mind game, which I included in this version

version 1.1, is the port to GNU/Linux of MasterMind

version 1.1.1, the current version, implements a basic translation system, and
adds an english translation to it

version 1.1.1b came from a patch by Felix Herrmann so that colorblind people
can play the game by showing the number of the inputs, besides of the color
