MasterMind 1.1b
by Javier Novoa C.


MasterMind is a game I've been developing since my school days. Occasionally
(sometimes separated literally by periods of years) I maintain and upgrade
it's capabilities. Since 1.1 I'm intending to not let it rot by time.

The most recent changes (which led to v1.1) finally made me program the port
to GNU/Linux using the curses library. Originally the program was done for
MS-DOS with the conio library, and developed, compiled and debugged through
Borland C++ 3.1 IDE. Now I've used MAKE, GCC and GDB as main developing tools
(and no IDE!), which means a great evolution (for me at least). By the way,
I've used these tools on Linux 2.6.22, on an OpenSuSe 10.3 distribution.

Please mind that MasterMind was originally written from a spanish language
perspective, so the interface of the program is currently in that
language. One of the TODOs in my list is to write a good localization support
for it, so that this won't be a problem any more. But even though this fact, I
consider the interface to be pretty simple, so it shouldn't be a problem
learning to use it by simple experimentation, at least until an english
interface is actually implemented.

MasterMind is free/opensource software under the GNU General Public License
v2, so please read the LICENSE file that is included with this distribution

For information on how to use the program, please read the online help
provided within the program itself (as I said, in spanish for the current
release).

For hackers, there's additional information on the TODO file. You may also be
interested in the BUGS file.

There is also a HISTORY file with the historic data for the program.
