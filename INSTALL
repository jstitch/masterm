MasterMind 1.1.1b


COMPILING
---------

MasterMind just needs the Curses library, so doing a

   cc masterm.c -lncurses -o masterm

might be just enough.

There is a makefile included, so running

   make

is the easiest way. Please mind that the makefile supposes you have GCC
installed on your system

There is a colorblind target, to compile masterm for colorblind support:

   make colorblind


RUNNING
-------

Once compiled, a file named masterm should be generated. Just run that and
ENJOY!
