BUGS
----

1) There is a bug when using a display terminal of less than 25 lines, the
messages displayed in the bottom line may get overlapped with other screen
output, specially in the 'playing the game' screen.

2) There is a bug in file cursors.h, in lines 330 - 342 for english
translation. The text is supposed to align words 'White', 'Yellow' and 'Empty'
to the right, just as it happens to work in the spanish translation. Work
needs to be done so that this generalizes for any translation.
